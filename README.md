# ourgaiaprojectgames

This is my first app made using Python 3.7

Abstract:
It is a setup generator for the Gaia Project boardgame i'm playing with friends.
It uses image manipulation code (PIL) to randomly arrange the various game tiles (map tiles, research tiles, round tiles etc.) into a full game setup.
Also, i made a nifty minimal interface using PyQt5 where you can choose the number of players (between 2-4).
