# ourgaiaprojectgames

This is my first app made using Python 3.7

The program is a setup generator for the Gaia Project boardgame i'm playing with friends. It promts you to choose the number of players then generates and returns an image containing the game setup for the choosen number of players.

It uses image manipulation (Pillow) to randomly arrange the various game tiles (map tiles, research tiles, round tiles etc.) into a full setup.
Also, i made a nifty minimal interface using PyQt5.

If you want to try it, you can  download Gaia.py and the img folder and run it by yourself (make sure to install Pillow, PyQt5 and wxPython libraries).

Alternatively, you can download the package with the .exe file and run Gaia.exe from here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18odQu_yPSeRHY3FZwBQ_vsbz7W-U1LJu?usp=sharing
